# Particle-Simulation
Simulation of particles interacting with each other in real-time created using Java. 

## How to download:
Note you must have Java SE Runtime Environment installed which you can find here: https://www.java.com/en/download/ 
- You can check if you have it installed by opening Command Prompt and typing "java -version" then pressing ENTER. If the console does not respond with "command not found", then it is installed. 
1. Download the ParticlePhysicsSimulator.jar file.
2. Run the file using Java(TM) Platform SE binary.
  - To run the file through Command Prompt:
    1. Change directories to the file location by typing "cd FILEPATH" and press ENTER where FILEPATH is the file path to the directory where the file is stored. 
    2. Type "java -jar ParticlePhysicsSimulator.jar" and press ENTER.
3. After opening the file, click the "CLICK ME" button for more details. 

If you wish to download and open the source code as a Java Project:
- Using Eclipse IDE:
  1. Download repository as a zip file.
